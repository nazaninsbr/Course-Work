entity relationship modeling:

	can be anything 
	a person, a thing or a conceptual (not physical thing)

normalize a database:
	
	ensures we have a well designed database for most of our systems
	applying rules to our data
	applying rules to end up with that entity relationship model 

load my data before or after I normalize?

	if you insert before then you need to change it after you normalize the database
	but if you insert it after then it is near imposible to normalize the database because you dont know what is in it
