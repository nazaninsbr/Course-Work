normalization:
	
	ralational model for databases 

	normalization in a process, a number of steps 

	when we normalize data in the end the entities end up being seperate objects 

	ensures we have a well designed database 

	we look at our data and apply rules to it


load after or before normalization?
	
	before:
		you find out it is not well desinged and you have to change it 

	after:
		with no data it is impossible to normalize because you dont know what the data is 

	so we would load a sample in that shows you what the data is but it isnt too big to cost us when we need to change the desing 


Terms:
	
	* Entity 
		a thing 
		represented as a table 
		group of individual things (people, records and ...)

	* Attribute 
		the columns of our table 
		like the age of the person 

	* Primary key 
		unique identifier 
		can be made up of multiple culomns that are not unique on their own but are when put together 
		can be one value like your "Student ID"

	* Candidate key 
		columns that are unique
		if we have more than one then there are more than one choices for primary key 

	* Surrogate key 
		when you normalize you might want to change this with primary key and see if the DB still works 

	* Dependencies 
		for example you can get the employees name when you have their ID, this is calle d a dependency 

Denormalization:
	
	we have normalized and then in denormalizatoin we are going back to a system that have less tables 
	the reason we might want to do this is that it takes a lot of time to answer quarries


--->	unnormalized -> normalized -> denormalized 
	
Common Forms:
	** every attribute must provide a fact about the key, the whole key and nothing but the key:D

	First Normal Form:
		cant have any repeating groups
		because like if we have 3 phone numbers why not 4? or which should we search?
			not efficient to search 
		no repeating columns 

	Second Normal Form:
		non key columns cant depend on the key 

	Third Normal Form:(BCNF)
		important if we have multiple overlaping primary keys 
		we should be able to apply the normalization to the other columns that could have been the primary key
