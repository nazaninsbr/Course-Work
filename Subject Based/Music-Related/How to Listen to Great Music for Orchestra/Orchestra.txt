The word orchestra originally referred not to a group of musicians, but to a place. In ancient Greece and Rome, it was the ground level of an amphitheater, and during the Renaissance the term was similarly applied to the area in front of the stage where instrumentalists sat and accompanied singing and dancing performances. By the eighteenth century, the term had acquired its present meaning of designating the ensemble itself.

The orchestra as we know it today arose during the seventeenth century, although large groups of instrumentalists existed long before (and after) that time. The central defining feature of an orchestra, as opposed to other such ensembles, is the presence of a core group of bowed string players. From the eighteenth century on, this group has been organized into sections that feature an unequal distribution of players, with violinists as the largest. In each section, the instrumentalists usually play the same notes. In addition to the strings, orchestras generally include a variety of woodwind, brass, and percussion instruments.

The tradition of a conductor holding a baton and leading the orchestra from a podium did not emerge until the nineteenth century. Prior to this time, the first violinist or keyboard player frequently served as the director.
