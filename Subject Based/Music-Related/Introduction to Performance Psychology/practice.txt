* you need to make practice as hard or even harder than the performance itself 

you can record your practices to double check after the end of your practice and figure out ways to make you sound better 

Presentation:

	as a child we measure practice with the number of times we have repeated something or by the amount of time passed, however if we are not paying attention our practice could turn into mideless repetition 
	good practice:

		#planning 

			goals or things they wanted to focus on that are specific and not too genral 

		#reflection 

			when we fail we need to recognize exactly what we did wrong instead of feeling bad about them self 



	when performing for others its important to get it right the first time not the second or third time so repetition might not be the best way, what can we do?
