Homo sapiens = man the wise --> because our intelligence is so important to us 

AI --> to understand AND build intelligent entities

Rationality (ideal performance) = a system is rational if it does the right thing given what it knows 

{
	human centered approach: [
		empirical science
		involving observations 
		hypotheses about human behavior
	]
	rationalist approach : [
		mathemathics 
		engineering 
	]
}

four approaches:
	1. thinking humanly {
		Congnitive Modeling Approach:
			
	}
	2. acting humanly {
		Turing Test : 
			- operational definition of intelligence 
			- computer passes the test if the human can not tell if the other one is a computer or a human 
			- if it wants to pass the computer has to have these capcabilities:
				* natural language processing (communicate in english)
				* knowledge representation (store waht it knows or hears)
				* automated reasoning (use info to draw conclusion)
				* machine learning (detect and extrapolate patterns, adapt to new circumstances)
			- physical simulation of a person is unnecesary for intelligence 

		Total Turing Test :
			- include video signal to test subject's perceptual ability 
			- capabilities:
				* computer vision (to percieve objects)
				* robotics (manipulate objects and move about)
	}
	3. thinking rationally {

	4. acting rationally {
