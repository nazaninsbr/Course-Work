another kind of supervised learning,
classification.
Classification is a technique that we can use to predict which
class, or category, something belongs to.
The simplest variant of this is binary classification where we predict whether an entity belongs to one of two classes.
It's often used to determine if something is true or
false about the entity.
For example,
suppose we take a number of patients in our health clinic,
and we gather some personal details, and run some tests, and
we can identify which patients are diabetic and which are not.
We can learn a function that can be applied to these patient
features and give the result 1 for
patients that are diabetic, and 0 for patients that aren't.
More generally, a binary classifier is a function that
can be applied to features X to produce a Y value of 1 or 0.
Now, the function won't actually calculate an absolute value
of 1 or 0, it will calculate a value between 1 and 0,
and we'll use a threshold value
to decide whether the result should be counted as a 1 or a 0.
When you use the model to predict values,
the resulting value is classed as a 1 or
a 0 depending on which side of the threshold line it falls.
Because classification is a supervised learning technique,
we withhold some of the test data to validate the model
using known labels.
Cases where the model predicts a 1 for a test observation that
actually has a value, a label value of 1, are considered true
positives, and similarly cases where the model predicts 0, and
the actual label is 0, are true negatives.
If the model predicts 1, but the actual label is 0,
well that's a false positive, and if the model predicts 0,
but the actual value is 1, well that's a false negative.
Now the choice of threshold determines how predictions
are assigned to classes.
