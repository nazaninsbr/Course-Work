what is machine learning:

	the foundation for AI
	train a software model using data then use trained model to find answers to new cases 
	create a data set and a model that can calculate the output 


	there are two broad kinds of machine
	learning, supervised and unsupervised.
	In supervised learning scenarios,
	we start with the observations that include known values for
	the variable we want to predict.
	And we call these labels.
	Now, because we started with data that includes the label
	we're trying to predict, we can train the model using only some
	of the data and withhold the rest of the data for
	evaluating model performance.
	We then use a machine learning algorithm to train a model
	that fits the features to the known label.
	And because we started with the known label value,
	we can validate the model by comparing the value predicted by
	the function, to the actual label value that we knew.
	Then, when we're happy that the model works,
	we can use it with new observations for
	which the label is unknown, and generate new predicted values.
	Unsupervised learning is different from supervised
	learning, in that this time we don't have known label values in
	the training data set.
	We train the model by finding similarities between	
	the observations.
	After the model is trained,
	each new observation is assigned to the cluster of observations
	with the most similar characteristics.
