how great leaders inspire action:

	why is it that people who seem to have the same talent and the same resources achieve somethings others can't seem to get close to?

		it's the way these people or companies act, think and do: the golden circle 

		why:
			not to make a profit that is always a result 
			the reason why your organization exists 
		how:
			how we are different or better 
		what: 
			every body knows waht they do 



the goal is to do business with people who believe what you belive 

human brain:
- Homosapien brain = rational and analytical thought and language 
- limbic brain = human behavior and has no capacity for language (it doesn't feel right, leading with your hearth or soul)


the law of diffusion innovation:
- innovators 
- early adopters 
- early majority (won't try something unless someone else has done it)
- late majority 
- lagers
