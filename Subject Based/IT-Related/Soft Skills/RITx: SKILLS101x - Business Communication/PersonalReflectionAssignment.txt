QUESTION: What is one opportunity for you to practice or improve this skill?

I think I usually use the director style for communication but some of my friends use the caretaker style and at times I talk to fast or make up my mind before they can get a word in so I think that will be a good opportunity to improve my skills. 

QUESTION: What is your plan for improving this skill?

well in the example given above it would be a good opportunity for me to try to see what the think and listen more and give them some time and to also show them that I value them and that I do care about their opinion, I could do these by going in with more of an open mind and to wait and listen before I decide and to tell them that their inputs are valued. 

QUESTION: What is one opportunity for you to practice or improve this skill?

I recently started working with two professors on research projects and the first session I went to meet one of the professors I could barely talk and I was sweating and stressed so I think working on that would be good, I do consider it an interview of sorts too but since I'm a computer major I don't usually end up interviewing people myself so that's the real-life opportunity that comes to mind. 

QUESTION: What is your plan for improving this skill?

I think going in a little bit more prepared, knowing what subjects I want to talk about should be something I do also for times that I have to present an idea of my own maybe practicing beforehand will be useful something else I noticed in my first interview with the professor was that he tried to get to know me better, asking me how I was doing in the semesters or what courses I planned to take so perhaps trying to connect just a little bit on the personal level. Regarding the connection, we meet in their offices all the time so I could use what I see there to find stuff to talk about with them. 

QUESTION:  What is one opportunity for you to practice or improve this skill?

As a student, I have to email professors when I want to be their teaching assistant or when I have a problem with a course or the grades so all those emails would be amazing opportunities to practice written communication. 
QUESTION: What is your plan for improving this skill?
I usually make good use of the subject line but I don't really call the person by their name all the time so that will be something I will work on, also I tend to get to the point fast because I am scared that the professor might not have that much time to read all my email but perhaps I should make sure they don't find the shortness rude. Something else I should try is better styling, I tend to only use text but I want to bullet points and lists to the email as well.
