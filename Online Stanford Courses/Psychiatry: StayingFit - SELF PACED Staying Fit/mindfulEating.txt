Sit down in front of your food. 
	Take a deep breath. Observe the color, shape (round, flat, oval), and texture (smooth, rough, ridged) of your food. Is it appealing? Do you want to gobble it up right away? Are you not really interested because you are worried about something else? Notice what you are feeling.

Notice your intention to eat. 
	Move your hand slowly toward the food, making a mental note of the action. You might say to yourself, “I am reaching for the food.” Describing your actions helps you to stay aware. Though this might sound odd at first, it’s helpful and really works, trust us!

Watch your hand move the food toward your mouth. 
	As it gets closer, pause, and notice the smell of the food. What do you smell? Does the smell bring back any memories or feelings? Notice what passes through your mind, and bring your attention back to the food and how it looks and smells in this moment. How is your body reacting to the smell? Are you hungry? Is your mouth watering?

As you put the food in your mouth feel the texture against your tongue. 
	What does it feel like in your mouth? As you begin to chew the food, notice the sensations in your teeth. Is the food soft, chewy, hard? How does it taste? Where on your tongue do you experience the taste? What happened to your arm? Did you set it down in your lap? Did you notice the motion?

When you swallow the food, notice the muscles in your esophagus contract and relax as they push the food to your stomach.
	Can you feel any sensations in your stomach? Is it empty, full, or somewhere in the middle? Notice your thoughts – are you thinking about the food or something else? If you are thinking about something else, gently bring your attention back to the food.
