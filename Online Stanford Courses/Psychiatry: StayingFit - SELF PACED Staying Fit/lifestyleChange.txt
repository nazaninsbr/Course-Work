Below are some things to do in advance to make sure barriers don't stop you from being physically active:

Be active earlier in the day, so darkness doesn’t discourage you.
	 How many times have you put off the jog only to look outside and think, nope, can’t run if I can’t see.

Do sports with a group or sign up for a class so that you have a scheduled time to exercise. 
	Exercise can be that much more fun when you do it with others!

Find a physical activity you can do no matter what time it is, 
	what the weather is like, or whether you are alone or with others (e.g., dancing in your room to the latest top 40 hit).

Have several activities to choose from or make a list, 
	so that you don’t get discouraged by the weather, your crazy work schedule or a sudden interest to clean your desk.
