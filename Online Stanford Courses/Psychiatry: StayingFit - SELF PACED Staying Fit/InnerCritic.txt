Many people have an inner critic that pipes up with negative thoughts when they're down. You need to defend yourself against these internal foes the same way you would against an actual person who criticized you for no reason. This is a great skill to learn because you can use it to improve your body image AND to cope with difficult emotions like sadness, anger, and worry.

To challenge negative thoughts, it helps to first understand how thoughts influence feelings and behavior.



Identify the specific thought that is contributing to your negative feelings.

Evidence Supporting: 
	Ask yourself, "What evidence do I have that supports this negative thought?" The key to this step is making sure your evidence is solid and not just an opinion. List unbiased evidence that another person would agree with that supports your thought.

Evidence Against: 
	Ask yourself, "What evidence do I have against this negative thought?" List unbiased evidence that another person would agree with that goes against your negative thought.

Reasonable Conclusion: 
	Weigh the evidence for and the evidence against the thought to reach a reasonable conclusion. Use your evidence to evaluate your original negative thought. Challenge your automatic thought with an alternative thought if it is inaccurate.
	
Act in a way that matches your conclusion
