Managing work and life responsibilities is rarely a question of "balancing" all of your commitments. The word "balance" can imply that you should strive for constant equilibrium between your work and your personal life. But trying to devote equal time to each of these every day is not always a possible, sustainable, or desirable solution.

Instead, we suggest finding ways to manage your work and life with deliberate strategies that are unique to you and may change over the course of your lifetime. Work-Life Effectiveness encourages strong performance for both individuals and organizations, with work environments that can respond to changes in business needs and give employees the tools they need to work smarter and address their priorities outside of work. Additionally, Work-Life Effectiveness helps organizations create more inclusive workplaces where everyone can thrive.


Harvard Business Review article:
	
	Research has in fact shown that employees who believe they do not have time for the personal life feel drained and distracted while they are at work.

	1. Strive for work-life effectiveness—not balance

	2. Define success in all categories of your life

	3. Maintain control.

		people may experience high stress when they feel out of control.

		“It’s important not to be so immersed in your work that there isn’t anything else. Taking care of your body and your mindset, carving out time to be with your family, doing things that recharge you — these all make you more productive in the end.” We should also proactively manage the direction and meaning of our work.


	“If your success is not on your own terms, if it looks good to the world but does not feel good in your heart, it is not success at all.”
