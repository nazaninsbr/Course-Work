My writing:

	I have acquired a number of skills throughout my life and academic qualifications, for instance I have learned a number of technologies and programming skills are part of my university courses and also by taking part in numerous online courses, I have also taken part in extracurricular activities such as being a part of the ACM and IAESTE student chapters, one skill that I have found to be extremely important is the ability to use creativity in order to solve problems,  as I have found doing the same thing as everybody else will result in the same outcome as any other individual is having and will result in no added value so when I was the magazine manager of the ACM chapter, I tried to take a different approach by creating a website for the magazine and opening the door to the online sell and presence of the magazine.
